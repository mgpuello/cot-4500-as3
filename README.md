# cot-4500-as3
The objective of this assigment is the use of numerical methods such as the Euler method and Runge-Kutta method designed to solve diferencial equations.
In the questions 1 and 2 we get a function and using the methods described above we find the better approximations.
In addition, questions 3 - 6 are dedicated to matrix operations using Gaussian Elimination, backward substitution, LU factorization, and numerical methods to determine if a matrix is diagonally dominate and if is positive definite.
To run this program select the file assigment_3.py and run it from the src. This can be copy and paste as well and run it using python 3.11.2
